CSC 690 Final Project

Author: Sebastian Drake (solo)

SFSU-ID: 913474853

Proposal:
Project will be a simple ios card based RPG.
You play as a character and fight against bosses.
There are 5 types of cards that can be played on a given turn:
"Attack", "Defend", "Heal", "Special", and "Prepare".
Each turn you draw 3 types of cards randomly and play one of them.
The boss then takes a turn and attacks you.
Repeat this process until the boss runs out of health or the player
runs out of health.

Inital wireframe for the app is in the home directory of this repository.

Must have features:
- Home screen with buttons
    - how to play
    - start game
- Screen with directions on how to play
- Character selection screen
  - at least 1 character to play as
- Main game screen
   - 5 types of action cards
   - at least 1 boss to fight against

Time estimates for project features:
Create UI views for all screens including the "graphics"(approx 5 hours)
Create logic for changing screens (approx 2 hours)
Create logic for character and boss (approx 5 hours)
Create logic for playing the game (approx 10-15 hours)

Nice to have features(features that I will work on if there is time):
- animations
- more than one character to play as
- more than one boss to fight against
