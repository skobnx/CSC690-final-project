Kanji Battle, A simple iOS rpg

Author: Sebastian Drake

Please run on a phone device sized iPhone 8 or larger.
App isnt optomized for smaller screens. 
I preformed most of my design and testing on an iPhone 11.

Proposal:
Project will be a simple ios card based RPG.
You play as a character and fight against bosses.
There are 5 types of cards that can be played on a given turn:
"Attack", "Defend", "Heal", "Special", and "Prepare".
Each turn you draw 3 types of cards randomly and play one of them.
The boss then takes a turn and attacks you.
Repeat this process until the boss runs out of health or the player
runs out of health.

Inital wireframe for the app is in the home directory of this repository.
See "CSC690_final_project_mockup.png"

Must have features:
- Home screen with buttons
    - how to play
    - start game
- Screen with directions on how to play
- Character selection screen
  - at least 1 character to play as
- Main game screen
   - 5 types of action cards
   - at least 1 boss to fight against
